Wireshark

This tool is a free and open source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communication protocol development. Originally named Ethereal, But the tool was renamed to Wireshark due to trademark issues.
Wireshark is a data capturing program that understands the structure (encapsulation) of different networking protocols. It can parse and display the fields, along with their meanings as specified by different networking protocols. Wireshark uses pcap to capture packets, so it can only capture packets on the types of network that pcap supports :


Data can be captured "from the wire" from a live network connection or read from a file of already-captured packets.
    • Live data can be read from different types of networks, including Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP, and loopback.
    • Captured network data can be browsed via a gui, or via the terminal (command line) version of the utility, TShark.
    • Captured files can be programmatically edited or converted via command-line switches to the "editcap" program.
    • Data display can be refined using a display filter.
    • Plug-ins can be created for dissecting new protocols.
    • Voip calls in the captured traffic can be detected. If encoded in a compatible encoding, the media flow can even be played.
    • Raw USB traffic can be captured.
    • Wireless connections can also be filtered as long as they traverse the monitored Ethernet.
    • Various settings, timers, and filters can be set to provide the facility of filtering the output of the captured traffic. 

And what about working with Wireshark? At first sight, it can be pretty intimidating but that’s allright.
When you open Wireshark, the first screen you’ll see is the main page. This main page will allow us to specify our interfaces as well as apply filters to narrow down traffic that we are capturing.
There are multiple interfaces to filter from you may have 1 or more interfaces to view. From here you can choose whether we want to perform a live capture on our interface or interfaces or load a PCAP for analysis. Pretty cool haha.
Well if you go to the filter box and click on the green ribbon we get a lot of options to choose, we’re going to select Manage Capture Filters so we can view a list of available filters. I’m not going in dept with the filters, this is very straight forward.



So for analysis we can open a PCAP file, when you do this the first important info about every packet is showed :
    • Packet number
    • Time
    • Source
    • Destination
    • Protocol
    • Length
    • Packetinfo
Also Wireshark color codes packets in order of danger level as well as protocol to be able to quickly spot anomalies and protocol captures.

Next on things you need to know before analyze a PCAP file is to understand the way to gather a PCAP file. Basic steps to gather a PCAP in Wireshark itself can be simple however bringing into traffic can both the hard part as well as the fun part, this can include :
    • Taps
    • Port mirroring
    • MAC floods
    • ARP Poisoning
