CVE-2021-3156
This is a new Unix sudo vulnerability discovered in january 2021.
This is a heap buffer overflow allowing any user to escalate privileges to root. This exploit will work with the default settings, 
for any user regardless of sudi permissions. At this moment the vulnerability has been patched, 
but affect any unpatched version of the sudi program from 1.8.2-1.8.31p2 1.9.0-1.9.5p1, so this vulnerability has been around for atleast 10 years from now.
Compared with the CVE-2019-18634 this vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the sudo program. 
However this time the vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow. The stack is a very regimented section 
of memory which stores various important aspects of a program. The heap is reserved for dynamic allocation of memory, 
allowing for more flexibility in how values and constructs are created and accessed by a program. 

Exploiting sudo with CVE-2021-3156
First of all, check the system for the vulnerability. There is an easy method to check this.
$ sudoedit -s '\' $(python3 -c 'print("A"*1000)')
First section = sudoedit  the man page shows it as sudo with -e flag, this option indicates that, instead 
of running a command, the user wishes to edit one or more files. In lieu (place) of a command, the string "sudoedit" is 
used when consulting the security policy. If the user is authorized by the policy, the following steps are taken.

If the system is vulnerable to the sudo vulnerability, the output of this command will be this.
# malloc(): memory corruption
# Aborted (core dumped)
If the system is patched te output will be
# usage: sudoedit [-AknS] [-r role] etc...

On Exploit-db download the CVE (Link in literature), compile the file. Compile will mean that the 
compiler will examine the functions in the script. Right now it is easy because we can automatically compile the exploit by the command 'make' 
$  make
When the system is done compiling, simpily input a command.
$ ./exploit-name [target]
The target can be 
0 (ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) with sudo 1.8.21, libc-2.27)
1 (Ubuntu 20.04.1 (Focal Fossa) with sudo 1.8.31, libc-2.31)
2 (Debian 10.0 (Buster) with sudo 1.8.27, libc-2.28)
Done.

($) stand for a input command.
(#) stand for output.
